 Execution Guidelines
 - Use available tools to track progress through this checklist and mark each step after completion.
 - Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs; mention if a step is skipped.
 - Use '.' as the working directory and avoid creating new folders unless requested (except .vscode for tasks).
 - Only install extensions surfaced by get_project_setup_info.
 - Avoid media or external links unless requested; use placeholders only with a note to replace later.
 - Tasks are complete when the project is scaffolded, compiled without errors, README and copilot-instructions.md exist and are current, and the user has clear debug/launch instructions.
